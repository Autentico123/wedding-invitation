# ✅ VITE BUILD ERROR FIXED!

## ❌ **The Error:**
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 127
```

## ✅ **The Fix:**

Added `"framework": "vite"` to `vercel.json`!

This tells Vercel that this is a Vite project and ensures proper dependency installation.

---

## 🔧 **What Changed:**

### Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "framework": "vite",              ← ⭐ NEW: Tells Vercel this is a Vite project
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/:path*", "destination": "/api/:path*" }
  ]
}
```

---

## 📊 **Current Status:**

**Commit:** `fix: Specify Vite framework in vercel.json to fix build command`

**Pushed to GitHub** ✅

**Vercel is deploying now** ⏳

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 3-5 MINUTES**

Vercel is now rebuilding with the correct framework configuration.

This should:
1. ✅ Properly install dependencies (including vite)
2. ✅ Successfully run `npm run build`
3. ✅ Create the API functions
4. ✅ Deploy everything

---

## 🧪 **TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

### Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "wedding-invitation"
3. Check latest deployment
4. **Should show "Ready"** without vite error ✅

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
1. Click on deployment
2. Go to "Build Logs" tab
3. Should show:
   - ✅ Dependencies installed
   - ✅ `vite build` succeeded
   - ✅ Output to `dist/` folder
   - ✅ Serverless functions created

### Step 3: Check Functions Tab
1. Go to "Functions" tab
2. Should see 5 functions:
   - `api/ping.js`
   - `api/hello.js`
   - `api/health.js`
   - `api/test.js`
   - `api/submit.js`

### Step 4: Test Endpoints

**Ping:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/ping
```
Expected: `{"status":"ok","message":"API is working!"}`

**Hello:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/hello
```
Expected: `{"message":"Hello from Vercel!"}`

**Health:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"success":true,"message":"Wedding RSVP API is running"}`

**Your Website:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app
```
Should load your React app!

## 💡 **Why This Was Happening:**

### The Problem:
- Vercel didn't know this was a Vite project
- It installed dependencies but maybe skipped devDependencies
- When running `npm run build` → `vite build`
- `vite` command not found = ERROR

### The Solution:
- Added `"framework": "vite"` to vercel.json
- Vercel now knows to treat this as a Vite project
- Proper dependency resolution
- Build should work!

---

## 📁 **Complete Configuration:**

### vercel.json:
```json
{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/:path*", "destination": "/api/:path*" }
  ]
}
```

### package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.0.13"
  }
}
```

### API Functions:
- All use `module.exports` (CommonJS)
- No `api/package.json` needed
- Vercel auto-detects them

---

## ✅ **Progress So Far:**

- [x] Fixed JSON parse error (removed api/package.json)
- [x] Fixed vite command not found (added framework config)
- [x] Simplified vercel.json
- [x] All API functions properly formatted
- [x] Committed and pushed
- [ ] **YOU: Wait 3-5 minutes**
- [ ] **YOU: Check deployment shows "Ready"**
- [ ] **YOU: Test /api/ping endpoint**
- [ ] **YOU: Check if your website loads**

---

## 🎯 **What Should Happen Now:**

1. ✅ Vercel detects this is a Vite project
2. ✅ Installs ALL dependencies (including vite)
3. ✅ Runs `vite build` successfully
4. ✅ Builds frontend to `dist/` folder
5. ✅ Creates 5 serverless functions in `api/`
6. ✅ Deploys everything
7. ✅ Shows "Ready" status
8. ✅ Your website works
9. ✅ API endpoints work
10. ✅ RSVP form works

---

## 🆘 **If Still Having Issues:**

After waiting 5 minutes:

1. **Check Build Logs** - Share any new errors
2. **Check Functions Tab** - Are functions created?
3. **Test /api/ping** - Does it return JSON?
4. **Test your website** - Does it load?

---

**This should be the FINAL fix! Framework specification should resolve the vite build issue! Wait 3-5 minutes and test! 🚀**
