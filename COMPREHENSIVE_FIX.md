# 🚨 ENDPOINT NOT FOUND - COMPREHENSIVE FIX

## ✅ Latest Changes (Just Pushed)

1. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Using Vercel v2 with explicit `builds` and `routes`
2. **Simplified all API functions** - Consistent async/await pattern
3. **Explicit routing** - `/api/hello` → `/api/hello.js`

---

## ⏱️ WAIT 3-5 MINUTES FOR VERCEL TO DEPLOY

Vercel needs time to:
1. Detect the git push ✓
2. Install dependencies (~1 min)
3. Build the project (~1 min)
4. Create serverless functions (~1 min)
5. Deploy to CDN (~30 sec)

**Total: 3-5 minutes**

---

## 📊 STEP 1: Check Vercel Deployment Status

### Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **"wedding-invitation"**
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (should show "Building..." then "Ready")

### Wait for "Ready" Status:
- **Building...** - Wait
- **Ready** ✅ - Continue to next step
- **Error** ❌ - Click to see logs

---

## 📋 STEP 2: Check Functions Were Created

After deployment shows "Ready":

1. Click on the **latest deployment**
2. Go to **"Functions"** tab
3. You should see these functions:
   - `api/hello.js`
   - `api/ping.js`
   - `api/health.js`
   - `api/test.js`
   - `api/submit.js`

**If you DON'T see functions:**
- There was a build error
- Check "Build Logs" tab
- Look for errors

---

## 🧪 STEP 3: Test Endpoints (After "Ready")

### Test in this order:

#### 1. Ping (Simplest)
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/ping
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "API is working!",
  "timestamp": 1759588...
}
```

#### 2. Hello
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/hello
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Hello from Vercel!"
}
```

#### 3. Health
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/health
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Wedding RSVP API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T..."
}
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Still Getting 404 After 5 Minutes

#### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" button
3. **Uncheck** "Use existing Build Cache"
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Wait 3-5 minutes again

#### Option 2: Check Build Logs
1. Vercel Dashboard → Latest Deployment
2. Click "Build Logs" tab
3. Look for errors like:
   - Module not found
   - Syntax errors
   - Build failed
4. Share the error with me

#### Option 3: Check Function Logs
1. After testing an endpoint (getting 404)
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Functions tab
3. Click on a function (e.g., `api/hello.js`)
4. Check if there are any runtime errors
5. Share the error with me

---

### Issue: Getting HTML Instead of JSON

This means the function is failing and Vercel returns an error page.

**Check:**
1. Vercel Function Logs for runtime errors
2. Environment variables are set correctly
3. Dependencies are installed

---

### Issue: CORS Errors

If you see CORS errors in browser console:

**Check:**
- Functions should have `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header
- Already added in all functions

## 🔧 Current vercel.json Configuration

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/**/*.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

In **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**, verify:

```
VITE_API_URL = /api
EMAIL_USER = your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = your-app-password (16 characters)
COUPLE_EMAIL = recipient@gmail.com
```

**After adding/changing environment variables:**
- You MUST redeploy
- Environment variables don't apply to existing deployments
