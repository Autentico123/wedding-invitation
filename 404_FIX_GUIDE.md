# 🔧 404 NOT_FOUND FIX

## ✅ Latest Fix Applied

Added explicit `functions` configuration to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x"
    }
  }
}
```

This explicitly tells Vercel to treat all `.js` files in the `api/` folder as serverless functions.

## 🚀 Changes Pushed

Commit: `fix: Add explicit functions config to vercel.json`

**Vercel should now automatically redeploy** (check your Vercel dashboard).

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES**

Vercel needs time to:
1. Detect the git push
2. Build the project
3. Deploy the functions
4. Make them live

---

## 🧪 **TEST AFTER REDEPLOYMENT**

Wait for Vercel to finish deploying, then test:

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard First
- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Click on your project
- Check "Deployments" tab
- Wait for the latest deployment to show "Ready"
- Click on it and go to "Functions" tab
- You should see 4 functions: `hello`, `test`, `health`, `submit`

### 2. Test Endpoints (After Deployment is Ready)

**Simplest:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/hello
```
Expected: `{"message": "Hello from Vercel!"}`

**Health Check:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"success": true, "message": "Wedding RSVP API is running"}`

**Test Endpoint:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/test
```
Expected: `{"success": true, "message": "Test endpoint is working!"}`

## 🔍 **If Still Getting 404 After Deployment:**

### Check 1: Verify Functions Were Created
1. Vercel Dashboard → Latest Deployment
2. Click "Functions" tab
3. Should see 4 functions listed
4. If not, functions weren't built

### Check 2: Check Build Logs
1. Click on deployment
2. View "Build Logs"
3. Look for errors related to API functions
4. Should show "Serverless Functions" section

### Check 3: Verify File Names
Make sure files are named exactly:
- `api/hello.js` (lowercase)
- `api/health.js` (lowercase)
- `api/test.js` (lowercase)
- `api/submit.js` (lowercase)

### Check 4: Manual Redeploy
If auto-deploy didn't work:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" button
3. Select "Use existing Build Cache" → NO
4. Redeploy

---

## 📋 **Current Configuration**

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Files
```
api/
├── hello.js    → module.exports = (req, res) => {}
├── test.js     → module.exports = function handler(req, res) {}
├── health.js   → module.exports = function handler(req, res) {}
└── submit.js   → module.exports = async function handler(req, res) {}
```

All use CommonJS (`module.exports`), no ES modules.

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### Before:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```
❌ Vercel wasn't detecting API functions

### After:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x"
    }
  }
}
```
✅ Explicitly tells Vercel to build API functions with Node.js 20

## ⚡ **Quick Checklist**

- [x] Conflicting `api/index.js` removed
- [x] Conflicting `api/rsvp/` folder removed
- [x] All API files use CommonJS
- [x] `vercel.json` has explicit functions config
- [x] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] **WAIT for Vercel to redeploy** (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- [ ] Test `/api/hello` endpoint

---

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

If after waiting and redeploying you still get 404:

1. **Share Vercel build logs** - Copy/paste the build log
2. **Share Functions tab screenshot** - Show what functions were created
3. **Try Vercel CLI deploy**:
   ```powershell
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

---

**Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to redeploy, then test! 🚀**
