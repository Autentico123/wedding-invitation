# ✅ FINAL FIX - NPX VITE BUILD

## ❌ **The Persistent Error:**
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 127
```

Even with `"framework": "vite"`, the vite command still wasn't found!

---

## ✅ **THE REAL SOLUTION:**

### 1. Use `npx vite build` instead of `npm run build`
- `npx` runs the locally installed vite package
- Doesn't rely on vite being in PATH

### 2. Ensure devDependencies are installed
- Added `--include=dev` flag
- Forces npm to install devDependencies (where vite lives)

---

## 🔧 **Final vercel.json Configuration:**

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps"
}
```

**Super simple and it SHOULD work!**

---

## 💡 **Why This Works:**

### Before (Not Working):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"  → runs `vite build`
}
```
❌ Problem: `vite` not in PATH, command fails

### After (Working):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build"  → runs local vite directly
}
```
✅ Solution: `npx` finds and runs the local vite package

---

## 📊 **Status:**

**Commit:** `fix: Use npx vite build and ensure devDependencies are installed`

**Pushed:** ✅

**Vercel deploying:** ⏳

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 3-5 MINUTES**

This deployment should:
1. ✅ Install ALL dependencies (including vite in devDependencies)
2. ✅ Run `npx vite build` successfully
3. ✅ Build frontend to `dist/`
4. ✅ Auto-detect API functions
5. ✅ Deploy everything
6. ✅ Show "Ready" status

---

## 🧪 **TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard
1. https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "wedding-invitation"
3. Wait for "Ready" status
4. **Check Build Logs** - should show vite build success

### 2. Test Your Website
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app
```
Your React wedding invitation should load!

### 3. Test API Endpoints

**Ping:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/ping
```
Expected: `{"status":"ok","message":"API is working!"}`

**Health:**
```
https://wedding-invitation-five-gray.vercel.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"success":true,"message":"Wedding RSVP API is running"}`

### 4. Test RSVP Form
Fill out and submit the form on your website!

## 📁 **What We Have Now:**

```
wedding-invitation/
├── api/
│   ├── ping.js       ← module.exports (Vercel auto-detects)
│   ├── hello.js      ← module.exports
│   ├── health.js     ← module.exports
│   ├── test.js       ← module.exports
│   └── submit.js     ← module.exports (with nodemailer)
├── src/              ← React app (built with Vite)
├── package.json      ← Has vite in devDependencies
└── vercel.json       ← Simple config with npx
```

---

## ✅ **All Fixes Applied:**

1. [x] Removed conflicting `api/index.js` (Express server)
2. [x] Removed nested `api/rsvp/` folder
3. [x] Deleted problematic `api/package.json`
4. [x] Simplified API functions to CommonJS
5. [x] Used `npx vite build` instead of `npm run build`
6. [x] Added `--include=dev` to install devDependencies
7. [x] Simplified vercel.json

---

## 🎯 **Why THIS Will Finally Work:**

| Issue | Previous Attempts | Final Solution |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| vite not found | Used `npm run build` | Use `npx vite build` |
| devDeps not installed | Default install | Add `--include=dev` flag |
| Complex config | V2 builds, routes | Simple config, auto-detect |
| Module conflicts | api/package.json | Removed, auto-detect CommonJS |

---

## 🆘 **If STILL Getting vite Error:**

### Check Build Logs
1. Vercel Dashboard → Latest Deployment
2. Build Logs tab
3. Look for:
   - "Installing dependencies" - should list vite
   - "npx vite build" - should run without error

### If vite still not found:
The package.json might have an issue. Share:
- Build logs (exact error)
- Whether vite appears in "Installing dependencies"

---

## ✅ **FINAL CHECKLIST:**

- [x] vercel.json uses `npx vite build`
- [x] Install command includes `--include=dev`
- [x] All API files are valid CommonJS
- [x] No conflicting files
- [x] Committed and pushed
- [ ] **YOU: Wait 3-5 minutes**
- [ ] **YOU: Check deployment status (should be "Ready")**
- [ ] **YOU: Check Build Logs (vite build should succeed)**
- [ ] **YOU: Test your website URL**
- [ ] **YOU: Test API endpoints**
- [ ] **YOU: Test RSVP form**

---

## 🎉 **This SHOULD Be It!**

Using `npx vite build` directly bypasses the npm script and runs the local vite package.

Adding `--include=dev` ensures vite is installed as a devDependency.

**Wait 3-5 minutes and check if your website loads! 🚀**

---

**KEY CHANGE:**
- `npm run build` → `npx vite build`
- This is the critical difference!
